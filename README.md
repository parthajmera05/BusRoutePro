# BusRoutePro

**Project Overview:**

The Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System is designed to enhance the operational efficiency of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) by automating bus scheduling and route planning processes. The system addresses the current manual, time-consuming methods, replacing them with a streamlined, algorithm-driven solution. It leverages data analytics and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies to optimize resource utilization, reduce errors, and improve service reliability for DTCâ€™s public bus transport services.

**Features:**

Linked Duty Scheduling: Allows assignment of a specific crew to a bus for the entire shift, ensuring continuity, accountability, and crew familiarity with the vehicle.
Unlinked Duty Scheduling: Enables crews to hand over buses after completing trips, with automated management of rest periods and reassignments for efficient shift rotation.
Route Management: Visualizes existing bus routes and offers tools for creating new routes while automatically detecting and highlighting overlaps with the current network.
Optimization Algorithms: Utilizes data analytics to optimize scheduling, crew allocation, and route planning to reduce congestion and improve service coverage.
Real-Time Data Access: Provides up-to-date insights and reports for managers, planners, and schedulers through a user-friendly interface.

**Technology Stack:**

- Frontend: ReactJS (or Angular), integrated with GIS libraries like Leaflet or Mapbox for route visualization.
- Backend: Node.js/Express for server-side logic, Python for optimization algorithms.
- Database: MongoDB for schedule and crew data, PostgreSQL with PostGIS for managing geospatial route data.
- Real-Time Communication: WebSockets for live updates on bus positioning and schedule adherence.
- GIS Technology: Mapping existing routes, highlighting overlaps, and optimizing routes using GIS algorithms.

**Expected Output:**
  
A fully functional prototype demonstrating:

- Automated bus scheduling with both linked and unlinked duty scheduling.
- Route management with optimized and visualized bus routes.
- Integration of real-time data for enhanced decision-making.
